# Runway Automation

You can use Runway Automation directly form APIFY platform [apify.com/igolaizola/runway-automation](https://apify.com/igolaizola/runway-automation)

## üé¨ What does Runway Automation do?

Runway Automation enables you to automate AI video generation on [RunwayML](https://www.runwayml.com) without manual intervention. With this actor, you can:

- ü§ñ Process multiple video prompts in bulk
- üé• Generate videos either from text prompts (text-to-video) or from images (image-to-video)
- ‚ö° Handle multiple jobs concurrently
- ‚è≥ Manage random wait times between operations
- üìÅ Generate an album HTML file for easy video browsing and downloading

### Video Generation Modes

- **Image-to-Video:**  
  If you supply image URLs (via the `images` parameter) or a Google Drive folder URL (via the `googleDriveFolder` parameter), videos will be generated using your images. If you also provide text prompts, they will be used as additional input. When there are fewer prompts than images, the prompts will be repeated (looped) to ensure every image is paired with a prompt.

- **Text-to-Video:**  
  If no images or Google Drive folder is provided, the generation will be based solely on the text prompts you supply. **Note:** When using the `gen3-alpha-turbo` or `gen4` models, direct text-to-video conversion is not supported. In these cases, if no image is provided, your prompt will first be used to generate an image using "RunwayML Frames", and then that image will be converted into a video. You can specify different prompts for the image generation and the video conversion by separating them with a vertical bar (`|`). For example:  
  `"A bomb with a time countdown | The bomb explodes"`  
  will use `"A bomb with a time countdown"` to generate the image, and `"The bomb explodes"` as the video prompt.

## üé• Accessing Generated Videos

The actor saves an `album.html` file to the KeyValue store, providing an interface for easy browsing and downloading of your generated videos. You can access it by:

- Clicking any "Album URL" field in the results table.
- Navigating to **Run > Storage > KeyValueStore** and locating the `album.html` file.

The album interface offers several features:

- **Filtering:** Search videos by prompt text or other metadata.
- **Batch Operations:** Select multiple videos for batch downloads.
- **Detailed Viewing:** Open videos in new tabs for closer inspection.
- **Download Options:** Download selected videos as a ZIP file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Guidelines and Best Practices

### Account Safety

- Automating Runway accounts may lead to termination.
- Use this actor only for batch jobs you would normally perform manually.
- Avoid running the automation continuously (24/7).
- Always follow Runway's terms of service.

### Performance Optimization

- Start with 1‚Äì2 concurrent jobs and adjust based on performance.
- Use proxies from your region to improve reliability.
- Set appropriate job timeouts based on your selected generation mode.
- Regularly update your session token if you plan long sessions.

### General Tips

- Test your setup with a small batch of prompts before scaling up.
- Use clear, descriptive prompts to keep your results organized.
- Monitor job success rates and tweak settings as needed.
- Note that failed jobs are logged but won‚Äôt stop the entire process.
